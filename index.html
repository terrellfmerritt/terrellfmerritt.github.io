            <h3>New York City Department of Education</h3>

            <p>
                As a member of the Specialized High Schools Diversity Outreach Team, I am tasked with providing information on 
                New York City's nine specialized high schools&mdash;public magnet schools typically regarded as amongst the 
                highest performing&mdash;to families of backgrounds underrepresented at the schools - including the black and 
                latinx communities.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>    
                On this team, I engage with community partners to disseminate information, plan informational presentations and 
                encourage families to take part in the admissions exam and/or audition process.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My communications experience and my status as a black alumnus of a specialized high school allow me to speak from 
                a professional yet personal perspective when engaging with and informing families.

            <h4>Sales Floor Team Member</h4>
            <p>
                I worked on the Sales Floor Team, maintaining the appearance of the sales floor and providing guests with 
                assistance and information. I also worked on the smaller Store Remodel Team, tasked with implementing a store
                transition by reorganizing the layout of various product types around the store.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In an effort to serve as a resourceful individual for guests and other team members, I took initiative to 
                familiarize myself with workflows outside of those I was expected to be proficient in.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I was proactive in assisting other departments when roles needed to be filled, being trained and working in a
                total of six different areas throughout my tenure.

            <h4>Student Manager, The Corner Store</h4>
            <p>
                I served as a student employee at The Corner Store, one of the most frequented dining locations on the campus
                of the Rochester Institute of Technology and the central convenience store of the Institute's residence halls.
                At The Corner Store, I was both a cashier and stocker.

            <br>
            <p>
                Understanding that working at a campus store meant most customers would be fellow students who would make return
                trips to the store, I made it a primary focus to provide customers with a positive experience whenever they
                arrived at the store.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I had the pleasure of being promoted to Student Manager in January 2017, being able to further the positive
                rapport by being empowered to solve customer issues at a higher level. I also utilized my inclination to "float"
                when necessary in allocating student employee responsibilities to address store needs.

                    <p>
                        During my time as a member of Key Club International&mdash;a high school, student-led community service 
                        organization&mdash;I utilized my knowledge of the public transportation system of New York City along with
                        the web design &amp; development skills I was learning to create a website providing transit directions to
                        volunteer events for the 600 members of Key Club International chapters in Manhattan and The Bronx. This 
                        was a project I started after I noticed the large volume of students who were reluctant to attend events 
                        if they were not familiar with how to travel to the location. My work led to the formal recognition of a 
                        "Divisional Transportation Chairperson" role. At the end of my tenure running the site in March 2015, the 
                        website had acquired over 4,700 unique page views and attendance by Key Club International membership at 
                        divisional events had increased substantially.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the active running of the site, it was hosted officially on the division's site, at
                        <strong>directions.nydkc11.org</strong>. For demonstration purposes, the site can be viewed below.
