                <p>
                    I aim to use the power of communications and technology to serve people and their communities.
                    I strive to mentor others along the way, lifting them up such that they realize their potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I naturally want to do what’s right and improve the lives of others to the best of my ability. At The City University of New York,
                    I use strong communications and marketing efforts to build the ability of the nation’s largest urban public university to improve 
                    the socioeconomic status of New Yorkers and others. While studying at CUNY’s The City College of New York, I served as the college’s 
                    first-ever representative on the National Committee of the Public Relations Student Society of America, the premier student-led 
                    preprofessional communications trade association. I have previously been involved in a data-driven outreach effort to improve access 
                    to New York City’s specialized high schools (some of the City’s highest-performing public schools) for Black and Latinx students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I work towards success, I will be a voice in the fight towards a truly diverse, inclusive and equitable society.
                    Growing up as a low-income Black person who fought to be afforded a number of opportunities, including attending the highly-regarded
                    Bronx High School of Science, I have the chance to guide others towards the keys I struggled to find.

                of the nation's largest public university. I help develop social media content ideas, write copy for announcements

                I helped initiate CUNY's presence on Spotify and TikTok, strategizing how to best utilize the platforms to further

                As a member of the Specialized High Schools Diversity Outreach Team, I was tasked with providing information on 
                New York City's nine specialized high schools&mdash;public magnet schools typically regarded as amongst the 
                highest performing&mdash;to families of backgrounds underrepresented at the schools - including the Black and

            <br>
            <p>    
                On this team, I engaged with community partners to disseminate information, plan informational presentations and

                My communications experience and my status as a black alumnus of a specialized high school allowed me to speak from

                I served as a student employee at The Corner Store, one of the most frequented dining locations on the campus
                of the Rochester Institute of Technology and the central convenience store of the Institute's residence halls.
                At The Corner Store, I was both a cashier and stocker.

                Understanding that working at a campus store meant most customers would be fellow students who would make return

                arrived at the store.

                I had the pleasure of being promoted to Student Manager in January 2017, being able to further the positive
                rapport by being empowered to solve customer issues at a higher level. I also utilized my inclination to "float"
                when necessary in allocating student employee responsibilities to address store needs.

                    <p>
                        During my time as a member of Key Club International&mdash;a high school, student-led community service 
                        organization&mdash;I utilized my knowledge of the public transportation system of New York City along with
                        the web design &amp; development skills I was learning to create a website providing transit directions to
                        volunteer events for the 600 members of Key Club International chapters in Manhattan and The Bronx. This 
                        was a project I started after I noticed the large volume of students who were reluctant to attend events 
                        if they were not familiar with how to travel to the location. My work led to the formal recognition of a 
                        "Divisional Transportation Chairperson" role. At the end of my tenure running the site in March 2015, the 
                        website had acquired over 4,700 unique page views and attendance by Key Club International membership at 
                        divisional events had increased substantially.

                    <p>
                        During the active running of the site, it was hosted officially on the division's site, at
                        <strong>directions.nydkc11.org</strong>. For demonstration purposes, the site can be viewed below.
